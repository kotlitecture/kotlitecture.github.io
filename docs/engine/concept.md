The library centers around the flexibility to seamlessly integrate any project as an input template, irrespective of its structure.
The key philosophy is to adopt a `take what you need, discard what you don't` approach.

This approach lets to:
- Focus on the solution architecture of the template without worrying about the syntax of the engine or its limitations.
- Understand the structure of the whole layer with all its dependencies.
- Assess how new functionality impacts the entire project when it is built in "fat" mode.
- Keep the engine simple and not tied to any structure.
