In terms of **Kotli**, any integration, technical solution, or business flow can be considered a `feature`.
Each project template consists of features. The greater granularity of these features, the more specific the resulting output structure can be.

The combination of different features forms the final architecture of the layer.
Comprehensive information about each of them can be accessed from the `Feature Sheet`.
