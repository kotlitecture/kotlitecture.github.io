When a layer is added to a project, you can either remove it or extend it with features using the `Layer Sheet`.

![Layer Sheet](img/layer_light.png#gh-light-mode-only)![Layer Sheet](img/layer_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

The sheet includes the following elements:

### 1. Template

Each layer is built on a specific template. This card displays information about the template underlying the layer.

### 2. Remove Action

Layer can be easily removed from the project by clicking on this button.

:::warning
This action is performed without confirmation.

### 3. Features

Depending on the chosen template, the layer can offer various features.
These features are logically grouped to enhance the understanding of both functional and non-functional layer requirements.
The tabs represent these groups. For convenience, the panel includes one special tab, `All`, to show all features in one list.

Behaviour:

- When a feature is selected, it is indicated.
- To add or remove a feature from the layer, just click on it.
- To display its details, click on the `three dots menu` when the cursor is over the feature.

### 4. Search

For convenience, it is possible to search for required features using one or more keywords (comma-separated).
When the search field has any value, all found features are displayed in a single list, preserving the natural order.
The search can be performed using any text of the feature (title, description, etc.).
