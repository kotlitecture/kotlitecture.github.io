When a newly created project is edited, a public HTTP link is generated to access it.
Such a link can be shared with anyone for the possibility to view or use your project.
However, if you or anyone else navigates to such a link and modifies its underlying structure,
it will lead to the creation of a new project and a new public link.

It means that the project under the link is immutable once the creator's HTTP session expires or if the browser page with the link is reloaded.
